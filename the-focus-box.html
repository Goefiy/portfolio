									<h1>The Focus Box</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/the0focus0box.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We are Fabio, Belle, and Jade, and we are Passionfruit. A team that has developed the product: Focus box for students. With the Focus box, you can choose certain colors that help guide your mood during studying, from focused to relaxed, high energy, or creative.
									 It also functions as a drawer where you can put your phone to create an even better learning environment. Our product also includes a CD that contains binaural beats, which contributes to better concentration; this way, you can still listen to music without using your mobile phone.</p>
								<p>Our goal is to help students concentrate while studying and to encourage learning. In doing so, we prepare the future scientists, astronauts, and lawyers to create a better world.</p>
								<h3>The Project, The Team, The Result</h3>
								<p>"Design and create a product with passion that contributes to a better world. You can make anything as long as you go through a design process. It doesn't have to be a digital product. At the end of the project, create a video that demonstrates how your product/prototype indeed contributes to a better world.‚Äù</p>
								<p>The group for this project had to consist of 3 people. Within our new class for the project, we formed a group based on our passions. Our shared passion was music and music production. We all played an instrument and wanted to make use of the Audio Lab at the HvA's TTH.
									With this in mind, we thought it would be interesting to explore the effect of music on students' learning process, and so, we started working on The Focus Box.</p>
								<p>I am very proud of our result; it aligns with all our passions and desires for this project, and we worked hard on it. I really enjoyed the fact that we were able to work on music at school; it was fun and interesting. We were able to make use of the Audio Lab and explore music production.
									During this project, we also made extensive use of the Makerslab. I spent many hours in this lab creating CD 3D holders, UV prints, and using the laser cutter to work with wood and plastic.
									I enjoyed the process of physically creating products alongside conducting research, the latter which is often encountered in class. It was exciting to learn how to operate machines I had never seen before. Throughout this project, I learned many things, such as teamwork with strangers, expanding my skillset, and learning to deal with failure.</p>
