								<p> <b>Dream it.</b>
									Space Chronic Industries strives to make space traveling available to the great public. 
									Before SCI, space traveling was no topic for your typical civilian, but for astronauts only. 
									SCI provides space-trips to whoever is willing to buy, which makes space-travel accessible.</p>
								<p><b>Live it.</b>
									SCI strives to create a future in which humans explore space safely and efficiently, inspiring generations to come.
									By providing innovative research and development solutions, we strive to push the boundaries of what is possible and develop new technologies to advance space exploration and discovery. </p>
								
									<h3>The Assignment, The Development, The Conclusion</h3>
									<p class="less space">"Along with your team, you'll come up with a company. The company 'sells' at least two things: itself and a service/product. Choose a subject/product/service that you all have an affinity with.</p>
										
									<p class="less space">	You are a small business, self-employed, or a start-up. You will design content for the website of your small business. This aligns with the company, business goals, user, user goals, and user questions.</p>
										
									<p>	The main goal of this assignment is for you to learn how content can help you design a better user experience. With this assignment, you demonstrate that you have achieved the learning objectives and that there is clear development based on the CMD competencies."</p>
									<p>Together with my team, we started on the assignment. The business we were allowed to create didn't have to be realistic, we all found it interesting to create something related to space travel, so we created Space Chronic Industries. A company that sends people into space.

										All content in our product is self-made, and it was incredibly fun to do.</p>

									<p class="less space">I am very pleased with our final result; it was quite challenging to have to invent all the pages and content, but we succeeded in the end. The teamwork within the team was of great help.</p>

									<p class="less space">We learned a lot about the user experience of our target group and how elements on a website influence it. We also worked with personas and mood, and designing for a specific frame.</p>

									<p>Our website is available in PDF form.</p>
